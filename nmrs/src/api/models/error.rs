/// # Examples
///
/// ## Basic Error Handling
///
/// ```no_run
/// use nmrs::{NetworkManager, WifiSecurity, ConnectionError};
///
/// # async fn example() -> nmrs::Result<()> {
/// let nm = NetworkManager::new().await?;
///
/// match nm.connect("MyNetwork", None, WifiSecurity::WpaPsk {
///     psk: "password".into()
/// }).await {
///     Ok(_) => println!("Connected!"),
///     Err(ConnectionError::AuthFailed) => {
///         eprintln!("Wrong password");
///     }
///     Err(ConnectionError::NotFound) => {
///         eprintln!("Network not in range");

///         eprintln!("Connection timed out");
///     }
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```

/// ## Retry Logic
///

/// let nm = NetworkManager::new().await?;

/// for attempt in 1..=3 {
